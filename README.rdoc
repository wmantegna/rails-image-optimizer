== LIVE DEMO

I'm running a live demo of this code here
https://image-optim-paperclip-exmp-41.herokuapp.com

Because I pay for this bucket, please do not abuse. This demo app is provided for developer testing purposes only; I reserve the right to delete any images uploaded for any reason, including copyright infringement or simply lack-of-space. Please do not upload any inappropriate photos or photos you do not own.


== Running me locally 

• Go ahead, clone me to your local drive

• Make sure ImageMagick is installed

• When running locally, you run me with SQLite

• Be sure to ```rake db:create``` and ```rake db:migrate```. You should notice only an ```assets``` table is created.

• Upload some large, un-optimized images. You'll notice the optimizer will create optimized versions

• When you upload assets, they will be created at public/system/. This folder is in .gitignore
